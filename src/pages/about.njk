            <p>We leverage the PropertyOne.AI platform to streamline our investment workflow and property management processes. This technology helps us stay organized and efficient as we grow our portfolio. Coming soon: PropertyOne.AI iPhone app for AI-enabled property management for solo landlords.</p>
