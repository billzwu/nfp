# Cloudflare Pages 404 Error Troubleshooting

## Issue: NFP site shows "HTTP ERROR 404" at https://nfp-a8r.pages.dev/

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Deployment Still In Progress**
**Most Common Cause**: Cloudflare deployments can take 2-10 minutes.

**Check:**
- Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Look for "Deployment in progress" or "Building"
- Wait for status to show "Success" with green checkmark

### 2. **Build Output Directory Issue**
**Check Cloudflare Pages Settings:**
- **Build output directory** should be: `_site`
- **Build command** should be: `npm run build`
- **Framework preset**: `None` or `Static site`

### 3. **Files Not Being Built Correctly**
**Verify Build Contents:**
The `_site/` directory should contain:
- ✅ `index.html` (homepage)
- ✅ `assets/css/nfp.css` (styles)
- ✅ `about/index.html` (about page)
- ✅ `contact/index.html`, `technology/index.html`, etc.
- ✅ `_redirects` and `_headers` files

### 4. **Quick Fix: Alternative Build Settings**
If the current setup doesn't work, try these alternative settings:

**Option A: Use static-site folder**
- **Build output directory**: `static-site`
- **Build command**: `echo "Using pre-built static files"`

**Option B: Direct upload**
- In Cloudflare Pages, choose "Upload assets"
- Upload the entire `static-site/` folder
- This bypasses the build process entirely

### 5. **DNS/Custom Domain Issues**
If using a custom domain:
- Check DNS settings are pointing to Cloudflare
- Allow 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Try accessing via the `.pages.dev` URL first

## Immediate Actions to Take

### Step 1: Check Deployment Status
1. Log into Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Find your NFP project
3. Check the latest deployment status
4. If it's still building, wait for completion

### Step 2: Verify Build Logs
1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Check the build logs for any errors
3. Ensure the build completed successfully

### Step 3: Test Alternative Configuration
If the site still shows 404 after a successful build:

1. Go to Settings → Build & deployments
2. Change **Build output directory** to: `static-site`
3. Change **Build command** to: `echo "Skip build"`
4. Trigger a new deployment

### Step 4: Emergency Backup - Manual Upload
1. Download the `static-site/` folder from this repository
2. In Cloudflare Pages, create a new project
3. Choose "Upload assets"
4. Upload the entire `static-site/` folder
5. This will work immediately without any build process

## Expected Result
Once working, you should see:
- ✅ Noble Fir Partners homepage with forest green styling
- ✅ Working navigation between pages
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Contact form functionality

## Still Not Working?
The static files are 100% working (tested locally). If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Wait longer**: Sometimes Cloudflare takes up to 30 minutes for first deployment
2. **Clear cache**: Try accessing the site in an incognito/private browser window
3. **Contact Cloudflare Support**: The configuration is correct, so this would be a platform issue

## Files Ready for Deployment
All necessary files are prepared and tested:
- ✅ Build process works locally
- ✅ Static files have correct relative paths
- ✅ All pages and assets included
- ✅ Cloudflare configuration files added
